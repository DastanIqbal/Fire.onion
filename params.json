{"name":"Fire.onion","tagline":"Browser + Tor Bundle For Android","body":"Fire.onion lets you browse the web anonymously by routing all traffic over a series of randomly-selected proxy servers using a technique called onion routing. All data is encrypted multiple times, analogous to the layers of an onion, so that each proxy can only decrypt a single layer. Addresses are encrypted together with the data to make sure that each proxy only knows the address of it's immediate successor and predecessor, but not the entire route.\r\n\r\n- Webbrowser + Tor bundle for Android\r\n- Completely self-contained\r\n- No other apps needed\r\n- Anonymous web browsing\r\n- Access to .onion sites\r\n- Privacy mode always on\r\n- No manual configuration needed\r\n- Gecko based web browser\r\n- Optimized for high security and privacy\r\n- Not asking for any unnecessary permissions\r\n- Download support (running over Tor as well)\r\n- Panic/Exit button\r\n- New Identity button\r\n- Settings","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
