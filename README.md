# Fire.onion (Browser + Tor for Android)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=onion.fire

Fire.onion lets you browse the web anonymously by routing all traffic over a series of randomly-selected proxy servers using a technique called onion routing. All data is encrypted multiple times, analogous to the layers of an onion, so that each proxy can only decrypt a single layer. Addresses are encrypted together with the data to make sure that each proxy only knows the address of it's immediate successor and predecessor, but not the entire route.
